# Learning of sky take-out
You may know the training company **itheima**(it's hard to leave a comment) 
and the project is called a must for Java backend developer to learn(I guess is especially for the **new hand**)

## Features 
I made some **improvement** based on the raw project,which mainly exists in **Mappers**  (For example, I optimized some sql query from O(n) to O(1)).

And you may browse the **commits history** to better know the different modules of this project and the detailed process when building it.

 
>  this project is still under construction
